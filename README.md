## ⚠️ **FAIR WARNING**
This script doesn't make your game completely unmoddable, but it does help **prevent** it only a little bit. **Other anticheat systems** will be added to this repository when completely done being made.

## 📌 **How to Get Started**
1. **Download the C# script** 📝
2. **Import it to your project** 🖨️
3. **Create an Empty GameObject** 🎮
4. **Drag the script** into the Empty GameObject you just created 🖥️
5. **Set the parameters** ✔️

**Boom**, the anticheat should be working after those simple steps!
