## 🤔 **Why This Was Made**
This project was created by a developer, for developers, with the simple goal of helping to **prevent modding** in games. I understand that a game developer obviously wouldn't want their game modded without permission, and to make the game unfair. But with this anticheat system, our goal is to help developers not get their game modded, it can get fairly annoying.

---

## ⚠️ **FAIR WARNING**
Please understand that this script doesn't make your game completely unmoddable, but it does help **prevent** it only a little bit. **Other anticheat systems** will be added to this repository when completely done being made.

---

## 📌 **How to Get Started**
1. **Download the C# script** 📝
2. **Import it to your project** 🖨️
3. **Create an Empty GameObject** 🎮
4. **Drag the script into the Empty GameObject you just created** 🖥️
5. **Set the parameters** ✔️

**Boom**, the anticheat should be working after those simple steps!

## 🤝 **Please give Credits!**
I worked pretty hard on this anticheat script, and I would like to be credited for my work, it would be the right thing to do and it further boosts this project to help other developers have a good anticheat system.

## 🤖 **Features**
- 🚫 **Blocks cheaters automatically**
- ⚙️ **Has constant checks** to see if you have assemblies that can mod the game
- 🥾 **Kicks players** if caught cheating (a banning system will be coming soon)
